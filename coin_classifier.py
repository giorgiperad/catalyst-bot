"""Single source of truth for coin classification.

Before this module existed, the codebase had FIVE different classifiers, each
with different thresholds, leading to inconsistent decisions across the bot:

    Function                                   | Floor  | Ceiling | Purpose
    -------------------------------------------+--------+---------+----------------
    _is_misfit_coin (coin_manager.py)         | 0.98x  | 1.50x   | absorb misfits
    _infer_designation_by_size (cm.py:364)    | 0.80x  | 1.20x   | new-coin designate
    _infer_reconcile_designation (db.py:798)  | 0.80x  | 1.20x   | reconcile designate
    _classify_coins_tiered (cm.py:286)        | 0.80x  | 1.20x   | legacy bucket
    _partition_coins_for_designation (cpw)    | ±1%    | ±1%     | coin-prep alloc

The inconsistency caused tonight's (2026-04-17) ladder-shape bug:

    A 23.4k CAT change coin was received from a sell fill.
    Reconcile classified it as `tier_spare/inner` (23.4k / 26.7k = 0.876 is
    within ±20% of inner tier size, so passes the 0.80x floor check).

    The misfit absorber would have correctly flagged it (0.876 < 0.98 inner
    floor AND 23.4k > 20.0k mid ceiling, so fits NO tier at strict bounds),
    but by the time the absorber scanned, the coin was already LOCKED in a
    new sell offer — because _select_coin_for_offer also accepted it as
    "good enough for inner" using its own laxer check.

The fix: every classifier in the codebase routes through classify_coin() in
this module. There is ONE set of thresholds, ONE classification vocabulary,
ONE authoritative answer for "what tier can this coin back?" Call sites with
different tolerance needs can pass different (floor_tolerance, max_ratio)
parameters, but the decision logic is shared.

Usage:
    from coin_classifier import classify_coin, CoinFit

    cls = classify_coin(amount_mojos=23_400_000, tier_sizes_mojos={
        "inner": 26_678_000, "mid": 13_339_000, "outer": 5_802_000, "extreme": 2_901_000
    })
    # cls.fit == CoinFit.MISFIT
    # cls.best_tier is None
    # cls.nearest_tier == "inner" (for diagnostics only — do NOT use as actual tier)
    # cls.designation == "unknown"  (for DB write)
    # cls.candidates == {"inner": CoinFit.UNDER_FLOOR, "mid": CoinFit.OVER_CEILING, ...}

Rules:
    1. A coin is a MISFIT when it does not fit any tier at strict bounds.
       It cannot back an offer (offer selector must reject it).
       It is a reshape candidate (absorber must absorb it into reserve).

    2. A coin is an EXACT match for a tier when floor <= amount <= tier_size.
       This is the preferred-use tier.

    3. A coin is an OVERSIZE_FIT for a tier when tier_size < amount <= ceiling.
       Usable for that tier (with acceptable slack), but prefer an exact match
       if one exists.

    4. Coins above the LARGEST tier ceiling are RESERVE candidates.
    5. Coins below the SMALLEST tier floor are DUST.

All thresholds are inclusive on the floor side, inclusive on the ceiling side.
Thresholds are applied as integer mojos after multiplying by Decimal to avoid
float drift.
