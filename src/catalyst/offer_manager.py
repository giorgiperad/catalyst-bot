"""Offer-lifecycle manager for ladder creation, requoting, expiry, and cancellation

The `OfferManager` class bridges pricing and risk output from `PriceEngine` and
`RiskManager` to wallet-RPC offer operations exposed via the `wallet` module.
It owns ladder construction, price-move-triggered requoting, expiry handling,
and batch cancellation, and it maintains `_bot_cancelled_ids` so `FillTracker`
can distinguish genuine fills from bot-initiated cancels.

Key responsibilities:
    - Build buy/sell ladders sized against available coin inventory
    - Requote offers when the mid-price drifts past configured thresholds
    - Cancel offers individually or in batches and track which IDs we cancelled
    - Coordinate with `Sniper` and `BoostManager` to avoid coin double-spend

Thread-safe via `_lock`. All mutating operations should be called while holding
the lock, and any coin reservation crosses through shared state guarded here.

        Instead of letting the wallet auto-select (and then polling to

        - Deterministic coin locking (we know exactly which coin)
        - No polling delay (~45x faster batch creation)
        - No coin reuse risk (we track used coins in-batch)

        Strategy: closest-fit — pick the smallest coin that's large enough.
        This minimises waste (avoids using a 10 XCH coin for a 0.1 XCH offer).

        Args:
            wallet_id: Which wallet to query (1=XCH, CAT wallet ID for CATs)
            amount_mojos: How much this offer needs to spend (in mojos)
            used_coins: Set of coin_ids already used in this batch (reuse guard)
            max_amount_mojos: Upper bound on coin size (exclusive). When set,
                coins larger than this are rejected even as fallback. This
                prevents a 5 XCH coin being selected for a 0.634 XCH offer in
                exact_tier_spend_mode — locking 87% of the coin as change.
                When no coin fits within [amount_mojos, max_amount_mojos],
                returns None so the slot suspends and triggers a topup.
            tier_sizes_mojos: Optional mapping of tier name → mojos used to
                strict-validate candidate coins via
                :func:`coin_classifier.classify_coin`. When provided AND

                even if they satisfy the raw amount_mojos / max_amount_mojos
                window. This prevents the 2026-04-17 regression where the

                "inner" slot even though strict bounds classified it as a
                misfit, producing a ragged ladder shape on Dexie.

        When a filled slot gets refilled, the mid price has usually drifted

        mid produces an offer that interleaves with surviving offers at
        their original prices, scrambling the tier ordering on Dexie and
        tripping the ladder-taper watchdog.

        This helper anchors refills to the tier they belong to:

        * **≥2 surviving same-tier offers** → interpolate between the
          tier's closest-to-mid and furthest-from-mid prices, by the
          slot's rank-within-tier. New offers slot into the gap in the
          tier's existing price band.
        * **Exactly 1 surviving same-tier offer** → use it as one anchor
          and the adjacent tier's boundary as the other. If no neighbour
          is usable, fall back to the live-mid grid price.
        * **0 survivors in the target tier** → fall back to
          ``_get_ladder_price`` anchored on ``mid_price``. The refill
          repopulates the empty tier from scratch at the current market.

        Sanity guard: if the interpolated price falls outside
        ``mid × (1 ± MAX_SPREAD_BPS/10000)`` returns None so the caller
        skips the slot. The graduated-requote path will rebuild the

        Belt-and-braces guard against the requote overshoot the bot got

        create-first requote rounds left the live book at 29 sells against
        a 24 cap. The over-allocation guard only blocked NEW creation; it
        never trimmed the excess. This method does the trim.

        When ``wallet_buys`` / ``wallet_sells`` are provided (from the
        wallet sync step), they are used as the ground-truth open-offer
        count instead of the DB.  This closes the gap where the DB has

        wallet still holds it open — the DB would show 12 (under cap)
        while the wallet shows 20 (8 excess).

        Strategy: pick the offers furthest from `mid_price` on each side
        (least useful market-making) and cancel them until count == cap.

        Returns: total number of offers asked to cancel (across both sides).
