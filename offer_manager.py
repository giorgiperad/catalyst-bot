V2 Offer Manager — Offer Lifecycle Management

        Instead of letting the wallet auto-select (and then polling to

        - Deterministic coin locking (we know exactly which coin)
        - No polling delay (~45x faster batch creation)
        - No coin reuse risk (we track used coins in-batch)

        Thread-safe: acquires self._lock to prevent concurrent coin selection
        from different threads (main loop, sniper, boost) choosing the same coin.

        Handles the "Wallet needs to be fully synced" error that occurs
        briefly during heavy operations. See CHIA_DEV_GUIDE.md Section 10.

        Two coin detection modes:
        1. coin_ids mode (V3): Pre-select a coin and pass it to make_offer.
           The wallet locks exactly that coin — no polling needed. ~45x faster.
        2. Polling mode (V2 fallback): Snapshot coins before/after, poll to
           detect which coin disappeared. Used when coin_ids is disabled or
           when coin selection fails.

        Args:
            offer_dict: {str(wallet_id): amount_mojos} — negative=spend, positive=receive
            max_retries: How many times to retry on transient errors
            expiry_offset: Extra seconds added to expiry for staggering
            expiry_secs: Override expiry duration (e.g., short expiry for sniper offers)
            used_coins: Set of coin_ids already used in this batch (reuse guard)
            preferred_tier: Optional target tier ('inner', 'mid', 'outer',
                'extreme', 'sniper'). Matching designated spares are preferred.
            strict_preferred_tier: When True, only coins in preferred_tier are
                eligible. If none are available, offer creation fails cleanly.
            coin_ids_enabled: If True, pre-select coins via _select_coin_for_offer()
            selected_coin_id: Optional coin ID chosen by the caller. When
                provided, this is used directly and we do not re-select.

        Returns the wallet RPC response, or None on failure.
        The response will include a 'locked_coin_id' key if coin detection succeeded.

        old ones.

        Simplified from the rolling-wave approach.  One pass through:
            1. Count spare coins available for this side
            2. Create new offers at the updated price (limited by spares)
            3. Post them to Dexie immediately
            4. Fire-and-forget cancel matching old offers (skip_confirmation)
            5. Return — the trim pass (step 12a) handles any residual excess

        No rolling waves, no cancel-first fallback, no inter-batch coin
        polling, no overalloc guard.  The trim pass already runs every
        cycle and cancels furthest-from-mid offers above the per-side cap,
        which naturally cleans up any slow-confirming cancels.

        Args:
            max_offers: If > 0, create/cancel at most this many offers.
                        0 means no limit.
            allowed_tiers: If provided, only target offers in these tiers
                           for replacement (graduated response).
