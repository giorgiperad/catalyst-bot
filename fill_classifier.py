"""
Fill Classifier — Identify the nature of offer fills.

Classifies each fill into one of five categories:

  RETAIL          — Individual user trading via Dexie; single offer, no
                    known arb wallet, no same-block cluster pattern.
  ARB_SWEEP_BUY   — TibetSwap (or similar) arb bot buying our sell offers.
                    Taker puzzle hash matches a known arb wallet.
  ARB_SWEEP_SELL  — TibetSwap arb bot selling into our buy offers.
  DEXIE_COMBINED  — Multiple of our offers were swept in the same atomic
                    on-chain transaction (same spent_block_index across
                    fills that arrived close together). The arb bot
                    combines several Dexie offers into one bundle.
  UNKNOWN         — Not enough data to classify confidently.

Classification is additive and non-blocking.  Failures in the classifier
never prevent a fill from being recorded — they just leave the
fill_classification column as 'unknown'.

Usage:
    from fill_classifier import classify_fill, FillClassification

    result = classify_fill(
        trade_id="0xabc...",
        fill_detail={"coin_id": "...", "side": "buy", ...},
        dexie_detail={"spent_block_index": 12345, ...},
    )
    # result.classification → "retail" | "arb_sweep_buy" | ...
    # result.confidence     → "high" | "medium" | "low"
    # result.taker_puzzle_hash → "abc123..." or None
    # result.spent_block_index → 12345 or None
