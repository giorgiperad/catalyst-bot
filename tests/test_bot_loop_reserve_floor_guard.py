"""Tests for the reserve-floor guard against failed balance reads.

Background: prior to this guard the bot interpreted a failed Sage RPC as
"balance == 0", which immediately tripped the reserve-floor breach and
mass-cancelled every open offer. A single Sage 401 (e.g. user changed
fingerprint in Sage) burned the entire ladder.

The guard now defers the reserve check whenever the balance read does not
return a usable wallet_balance payload — the next cycle will retry once
Sage recovers.
