Pytest configuration — test collection, isolation, and encoding settings.

Fixes:
- Excludes standalone diagnostic scripts that crash pytest collection
- Sets UTF-8 encoding for stdout/stderr capture on Windows (prevents
  UnicodeDecodeError from emoji output in print() statements when pytest
  tries to decode its capture buffer with cp1252)

# Force UTF-8 for pytest's stdout/stderr capture on Windows.
#
# On Windows, the default console encoding is cp1252 (or the OEM code page).
# Our bot code contains emoji (✅, 🎯, 💰, ×) and Unicode math symbols in
# print() statements. When these are captured by pytest, the bytes land in
# the capture buffer. When pytest later tries to decode the buffer as UTF-8
# (for display in its output), an isolated 0x97 continuation byte (part of
# the UTF-8 × sequence \xc3\x97, split across two capture reads) causes
# UnicodeDecodeError inside contextlib._GeneratorContextManager.__exit__,
# appearing as hundreds of spurious "ERROR at setup/teardown" lines.
#
# The os.environ approach doesn't help because Python has already determined
# sys.stdout's encoding at process start. We must reconfigure the actual
# stream objects AND set the env var for any child processes.

# sys.modules isolation between test files.
#
# Several test files install stub `sys.modules` entries for `database`,
# `wallet`, `wallet_sage`, `coin_manager`, etc. to isolate the module
# under test from the real bot dependencies. A few had buggy tearDowns
# that popped those entries instead of restoring the originals — leaving
# later files to re-import fresh copies of those modules which then broke
# `patch(...)` calls that assume sys.modules still holds the original.
#
# This autouse fixture snapshots `sys.modules` before each test module is
# loaded and restores the snapshot after, so file-level leaks can't reach
# the next file even if individual teardowns are sloppy.
