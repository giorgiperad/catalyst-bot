"""
Offer Lifecycle — Canonical state machine for offer tracking.

Adapted from Greenfloor's offer_lifecycle.py but extended for our
desktop bot's real flows: requoting, cancel retries, fill verification,
phantom/self-spend rejection, and Dexie posting.

The existing DB column `status` (CHECK: open|filled|cancelled|expired)
is preserved for backward compatibility. A new `lifecycle_state` column
stores the extended state. The helper `coarse_status()` maps extended
states back to the 4 legacy values for old queries.

Usage:
    from offer_lifecycle import OfferState, OfferSignal, apply_signal
    transition = apply_signal(OfferState.OPEN, OfferSignal.CANCEL_SENT)
    # transition.new_state == OfferState.CANCEL_REQUESTED
    # transition.action == "await_cancel_confirm"
